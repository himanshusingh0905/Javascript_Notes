# JavaScript-Notes-Codes
A complete walk-through to all practices of javascript.

## Similarities to python:
1. Just like python it is 'dynamic typed'. But here we use another keyword 'let'
2. **null** vs **None** :
    * In python, there's ***None*** type
    * In javascript, it is ***null*** type.
3. **for-in**  vs **for-of**:
    * *for-in*  loop in **python** and *for-of*  loop in **javascript** are similar

## Dissimilarities to python :
1. Unlike python, here indentation is not required.
2. Unlike python, here scope is defined by {}
3.   **def**  vs   **function**  keyword: 
      * In python, function declaration -> using **def** keyword. 
      * In Javascript, using **function** keyword

4. There is no ***undefined***, ***NaN*** in python, but in js does.
5. python doesn't support block-scope. But javascript does, when 'let' is used to declare variables.
